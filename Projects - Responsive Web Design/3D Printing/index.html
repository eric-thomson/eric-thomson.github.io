              <p class="card-description">
                First up is PLA, or polylactic acid. Unlike most other filaments that contain petroleum, PLA is made from organic materials. This thermoplastic monomer is user- and environmentally friendly, doesn’t easily warp during printing, and it’s food-safe, too. It’s not water-soluble, but it can be dissolved with acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, or caustic soda. PLA is, however, a bit more fragile than some other filaments, and doesn’t have a good UV resistance.

              <p class="card-title">ABS</p>
              <p class="card-description">
                Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, or ABS, is a popular engineering plastic and 3D printing filament type that’s tough and can hold its own in high temperatures—which is just as well because printing with ABS uses high temperatures for both the hot end and the printer bed.
It needs heated build volumes in order to get proper results since ABS can warp during printing, leading to inaccurate dimensions. ABS is known for its durability; it’s impact resistant and can survive wear and tear.

              <p class="card-description">
                Filaments filled with carbon fiber are made with enhancing additives to improve their mechanical properties or overall appearance. They have better dimensional stability than some other types of filament, and don’t warp as much. They can increase the durability of ABS, but are more brittle and likely to clog. Carbon fiber filament can be dissolved with organic solvents.

              <p class="card-description">
                FLEX filament is a proprietary blend of polymers that creates a flexible copolymer 3D printing filament type. It’s part of the thermoplastic polyurethane, or TPU, family of materials. Parts printed with this material can attain a shore A hardness of 93 A. The parts are also flexible and impact resistant, as well as hygroscopic. This means they should be dried before use, and kept dry during long prints. This filament is durable by nature, as are most flexible materials, and it won’t warp, either.
